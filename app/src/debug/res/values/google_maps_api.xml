    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=B7:E9:B8:40:C3:AF:B2:32:AD:06:41:41:C8:B3:E0:7E:4B:D4:86:E4%3Bcom.example.toodaloo

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.example.toodaloo

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    B7:E9:B8:40:C3:AF:B2:32:AD:06:41:41:C8:B3:E0:7E:4B:D4:86:E4

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
